# CSCI 4830 - Web Accessibility Example

This repo contains two webpages. They are both visually identical, minus some slight alignment differences. 

A5.html is entirely impossible to read with a screenreader. It uses outdated tags, No headings, no paragraph tags, no alt text, and images for elements that should be plain text.

A5-fixed.html is much easier to navigate, and fixes (hopefully) all of the problems of A5.html
